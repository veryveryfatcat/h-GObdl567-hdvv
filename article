Brief summary of the article:

This article, dated February 2, 2023, describes how Huntress detected an intrusion in a protected environment (Apache Tomcat Java web application server), related to a zero-day vulnerability in the GoAnywhere MFT software, later identified under the reference CVE-2023-0669. This vulnerability allowed remote code execution (RCE) via an exposed administration interface, enabling attackers to exploit the flaw to gain access to the system and execute malicious commands.

The initial alert concerned the use of certutil to download a remote file, followed by the execution of this file via rundll32.exe. The investigation revealed that the malicious file, associated with a known malware named Truebot, was downloaded and executed to establish persistence on the system. This file was stored in a public directory (C:\Users\Public) to mask its activity.

The scheduled tasks created to execute this malicious file mimicked NVIDIA crash reports, a technique commonly used by attackers to hide their actions and disguise themselves as legitimate processes.
On February 7, 2023, Fortra, the provider of GoAnywhere, released a patch for this vulnerability, which is now fixed in version 7.1.2 and later.
